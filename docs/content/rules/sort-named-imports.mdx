Enforce sorted named imports.

Sorting named imports promotes a standardized ordering, making it easier for developers to navigate and understand import statements.

This rule ensures that named imports are consistently organized, enhancing the readability and maintainability of the code. By keeping imports sorted, developers can quickly locate necessary modules and maintain a clean code structure.

<Important>
If you use the [`sort-imports`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/sort-imports) rule, it is highly recommended to [disable it](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#using-configuration-files-1) to avoid conflicts.
</Important>

## Try it out

<CodeExample
  alphabetical={dedent`
    import {
      createContext,
      useEffect,
      useId,
      useLayoutEffect,
      useReducer,
      useRef,
      useState,
    } from 'react'

    import {
      createBrowserRouter,
      Link,
      Route,
      RouterProvider,
    } from 'react-router-dom'

    import { useDispatch, useStore } from 'react-redux'
  `}
  lineLength={dedent`
    import {
      useLayoutEffect,
      createContext,
      useReducer,
      useEffect,
      useState,
      useRef,
      useId,
    } from 'react'

    import {
      createBrowserRouter,
      RouterProvider,
      Route,
      Link,
    } from 'react-router-dom'

    import { useDispatch, useStore } from 'react-redux'
  `}
  initial={dedent`
    import {
      useReducer,
      useRef,
      createContext,
      useEffect,
      useLayoutEffect,
      useId,
      useState,
    } from 'react'

    import {
      Route,
      createBrowserRouter,
      RouterProvider,
      Link,
    } from 'react-router-dom'

    import { useStore, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'
  `}
  client:load
  lang="tsx"
/>

## Options

This rule accepts an options object with the following properties:

### type

<sub>default: `'alphabetical'`</sub>

Specifies the sorting method.

- `'alphabetical'` — Sort items alphabetically (e.g., “a” < “b” < “c”) using [localeCompare](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare).
- `'natural'` — Sort items in a [natural](https://github.com/yobacca/natural-orderby) order (e.g., “item2” < “item10”).
- `'line-length'` — Sort items by the length of the code line (shorter lines first).
- `'custom'` — Sort items using the alphabet entered in the [`alphabet`](#alphabet) option.
- `'unsorted'` — Do not sort items. [`grouping`](#groups) and [`newlines behavior`](#newlinesbetween) are still enforced.

### order

<sub>default: `'asc'`</sub>

Determines whether the sorted items should be in ascending or descending order.

- `'asc'` — Sort items in ascending order (A to Z, 1 to 9).
- `'desc'` — Sort items in descending order (Z to A, 9 to 1).

### fallbackSort

<sub>
  type:
  ```
  {
    type: 'alphabetical' | 'natural' | 'line-length' | 'custom' | 'unsorted'
    order?: 'asc' | 'desc'
  }
  ```
</sub>
<sub>default: `{ type: 'unsorted' }`</sub>

Defines a list of fallback sort options to use when comparing two elements that are equal according to the primary sort
[`type`](#type).

Example: enforce alphabetical sort between two elements with the same length.
```ts
{
  type: 'line-length',
  order: 'desc'
  fallbackSort: { type: 'alphabetical', order: 'asc' }
}
```

### alphabet

<sub>default: `''`</sub>

Only used when the [`type`](#type) option is set to `'custom'`. Specifies the custom alphabet to use when sorting.

Use the `Alphabet` utility class from `eslint-plugin-perfectionist/alphabet` to quickly generate a custom alphabet.

Example: `0123456789abcdef...`

### ignoreCase

<sub>default: `true`</sub>

Controls whether sorting should be case-sensitive or not.

- `true` — Ignore case when sorting alphabetically or naturally (e.g., “A” and “a” are the same).
- `false` — Consider case when sorting (e.g., “a” comes before “A”).

### specialCharacters

<sub>default: `keep`</sub>

Controls whether special characters should be trimmed, removed or kept before sorting.

- `'keep'` — Keep special characters when sorting (e.g., “_a” comes before “a”).
- `'trim'` — Trim special characters when sorting alphabetically or naturally (e.g., “_a” and “a” are the same).
- `'remove'` — Remove special characters when sorting (e.g., “/a/b” and “ab” are the same).

### locales

<sub>default: `'en-US'`</sub>

Specifies the sorting locales. See [String.prototype.localeCompare() - locales](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare#locales).

- `string` — A BCP 47 language tag (e.g. `'en'`, `'en-US'`, `'zh-CN'`).
- `string[]` — An array of BCP 47 language tags.

### ignoreAlias

<sub>default: `false`</sub>

Determines whether to use the import alias as the name for sorting instead of the exported name.

- `true` — Use the import alias for sorting.
- `false` — Use the exported name for sorting.

### [DEPRECATED] groupKind

<sub>default: `'mixed'`</sub>

Use the [groups](#groups) option with the `value` and `type` modifiers instead.

Allows you to group named imports by their kind, determining whether value imports should come before or after type imports.

- `mixed` — Do not group named imports by their kind; named imports statements are sorted together regardless of their type.
- `values-first` — Group all value imports before type imports.
- `types-first` — Group all type imports before value imports.

### partitionByComment

<sub>default: `false`</sub>

Allows you to use comments to separate the members of named imports into logical groups. This can help in organizing and maintaining large named imports by creating partitions based on comments.

- `true` — All comments will be treated as delimiters, creating partitions.
- `false` — Comments will not be used as delimiters.
- `RegExpPattern = string | { pattern: string; flags: string}` — A regexp pattern to specify which comments should act as delimiters.
- `RegExpPattern[]` — A list of regexp patterns to specify which comments should act as delimiters.
- `{ block: boolean | RegExpPattern | RegExpPattern[]; line: boolean | RegExpPattern | RegExpPattern[] }` — Specify which block and line comments should act as delimiters.

### partitionByNewLine

<sub>default: `false`</sub>

When `true`, the rule will not sort the members of named imports if there is an empty line between them. This can be useful for keeping logically separated groups of members in their defined order.

```ts
import {
     // Group 1
    Drone,
    Keyboard,
    Mouse,
    Smartphone,

    // Group 2
    Laptop,
    Monitor,
    Smartwatch,
    Tablet,

    // Group 3
    Headphones,
    Router,
} from './devices'
```

### newlinesBetween

<sub>default: `'ignore'`</sub>

Specifies how new lines should be handled between groups.

- `ignore` — Do not report errors related to new lines.
- `always` — Enforce one new line between each group, and forbid new lines inside a group.
- `never` — No new lines are allowed.

You can also enforce the newline behavior between two specific groups through the `groups` options.

See the [`groups`](#newlines-between-groups) option.

This option is only applicable when `partitionByNewLine` is `false`.

### groups

<sub>
  type: `Array<string | string[]>`
</sub>
<sub>default: `[]`</sub>

Allows you to specify a list of named imports groups for sorting. Groups help organize named imports into categories, making them more readable and maintainable.

Each named import will be assigned a single group specified in the `groups` option (or the `unknown` group if no match is found).
The order of items in the `groups` option determines how groups are ordered.

Within a given group, members will be sorted according to the `type`, `order`, `ignoreCase`, etc. options.

Individual groups can be combined together by placing them in an array. The order of groups in that array does not matter.
All members of the groups in the array will be sorted together as if they were part of a single group.

Predefined groups are characterized by a single selector and potentially multiple modifiers. You may enter modifiers in any order, but the selector must always come at the end.

#### Selectors

The only selector possible for this rule is `import`.

#### Modifiers

- `value`: Matches value imports.
- `type`: Matches type imports.

Example: `type-import`.

#### Important notes

##### The `unknown` group

Members that don’t fit into any group specified in the `groups` option will be placed in the `unknown` group. If the `unknown` group is not specified in the `groups` option,
it will automatically be added to the end of the list.

##### Newlines between groups

You may place `newlinesBetween` objects between your groups to enforce the newline behavior between two specific groups.

See the [`newlinesBetween`](#newlinesbetween) option.

This feature is only applicable when `partitionByNewLine` is false.

```ts
{
  newlinesBetween: 'always',
  groups: [
    'a',
    { newlinesBetween: 'never' }, // Overrides the global newlinesBetween option
    'b',
  ]
}
```

### customGroups

<sub>
  type: `Array<CustomGroupDefinition | CustomGroupAnyOfDefinition>`
</sub>
<sub>default: `[]`</sub>

You can define your own groups and use regexp patterns to match specific named imports.

A custom group definition may follow one of the two following interfaces:

```ts
interface CustomGroupDefinition {
  groupName: string
  type?: 'alphabetical' | 'natural' | 'line-length' | 'unsorted'
  order?: 'asc' | 'desc'
  fallbackSort?: { type: string; order?: 'asc' | 'desc' }
  newlinesInside?: 'always' | 'never'
  selector?: string
  elementNamePattern?: string | string[] | { pattern: string; flags?: string } | { pattern: string; flags?: string }[]
}

```
A named import will match a `CustomGroupDefinition` group if it matches all the filters of the custom group's definition.

or:

```ts
interface CustomGroupAnyOfDefinition {
  groupName: string
  type?: 'alphabetical' | 'natural' | 'line-length' | 'unsorted'
  order?: 'asc' | 'desc'
  fallbackSort?: { type: string; order?: 'asc' | 'desc' }
  newlinesInside?: 'always' | 'never'
  anyOf: Array<{
      selector?: string
      elementNamePattern?: string | string[] | { pattern: string; flags?: string } | { pattern: string; flags?: string }[]
  }>
}
```

A named import will match a `CustomGroupAnyOfDefinition` group if it matches all the filters of at least one of the `anyOf` items.

#### Attributes

- `groupName`: The group's name, which needs to be put in the `groups` option.
- `selector`: Filter on the `selector` of the element.
- `elementNamePattern`: If entered, will check that the name of the element matches the pattern entered.
- `type`: Overrides the sort type for that custom group. `unsorted` will not sort the group.
- `order`: Overrides the sort order for that custom group.
- `fallbackSort`: Overrides the fallbackSort option for that custom group.
- `newlinesInside`: Enforces a specific newline behavior between elements of the group.

#### Match importance

The `customGroups` list is ordered:
The first custom group definition that matches an element will be used.

Custom groups have a higher priority than any predefined group.
