Enforce sorted named imports.

Sorting named imports promotes a standardized ordering, making it easier for developers to navigate and understand import statements.

This rule ensures that named imports are consistently organized, enhancing the readability and maintainability of the code. By keeping imports sorted, developers can quickly locate necessary modules and maintain a clean code structure.

<Important>
If you use the [`sort-imports`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/sort-imports) rule, it is highly recommended to [disable it](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#using-configuration-files-1) to avoid conflicts.

## Try it out

<CodeExample
  alphabetical={dedent`
    import {
      createContext,
      useEffect,
      useId,
      useLayoutEffect,
      useReducer,
      useRef,
      useState,
    } from 'react'

    import {
      createBrowserRouter,
      Link,
      Route,
      RouterProvider,
    } from 'react-router-dom'

    import { useDispatch, useStore } from 'react-redux'
  `}
  lineLength={dedent`
    import {
      useLayoutEffect,
      createContext,
      useReducer,
      useEffect,
      useState,
      useRef,
      useId,
    } from 'react'

    import {
      createBrowserRouter,
      RouterProvider,
      Route,
      Link,
    } from 'react-router-dom'

    import { useDispatch, useStore } from 'react-redux'
  `}
  initial={dedent`
    import {
      useReducer,
      useRef,
      createContext,
      useEffect,
      useLayoutEffect,
      useId,
      useState,
    } from 'react'

    import {
      Route,
      createBrowserRouter,
      RouterProvider,
      Link,
    } from 'react-router-dom'

    import { useStore, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'
  `}
  client:load
  lang="tsx"

## Options

This rule accepts an options object with the following properties:

### type

<sub>default: `'alphabetical'`</sub>

Specifies the sorting method.

- `'alphabetical'` — Sort items alphabetically (e.g., “a” < “b” < “c”) using [localeCompare](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare).
- `'natural'` — Sort items in a [natural](https://github.com/litejs/natural-compare-lite) order (e.g., “item2” < “item10”).
- `'line-length'` — Sort items by the length of the code line (shorter lines first).

### order

<sub>default: `'asc'`</sub>

Determines whether the sorted items should be in ascending or descending order.

- `'asc'` — Sort items in ascending order (A to Z, 1 to 9).
- `'desc'` — Sort items in descending order (Z to A, 9 to 1).

### ignoreCase

<sub>default: `true`</sub>

Controls whether sorting should be case-sensitive or not.

- `true` — Ignore case when sorting alphabetically or naturally (e.g., “A” and “a” are the same).
- `false` — Consider case when sorting (e.g., “a” comes before “A”).

### specialCharacters

<sub>default: `keep`</sub>

Controls whether special characters should be trimmed, removed or kept before sorting.

- `'keep'` — Keep special characters when sorting (e.g., “_a” comes before “a”).
- `'trim'` — Trim special characters when sorting alphabetically or naturally (e.g., “_a” and “a” are the same).
- `'remove'` — Remove special characters when sorting (e.g., “/a/b” and “ab” are the same).

### locales

<sub>default: `'en-US'`</sub>

Specifies the sorting locales. See [String.prototype.localeCompare() - locales](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare#locales).

- `string` — A BCP 47 language tag (e.g. `'en'`, `'en-US'`, `'zh-CN'`).
- `string[]` — An array of BCP 47 language tags.

**Note:** Only effective when `type` is `alphabetical`.

### ignoreAlias

<sub>default: `false`</sub>

Determines whether to use the import alias as the name for sorting instead of the exported name.

- `true` — Use the import alias for sorting.
- `false` — Use the exported name for sorting.

### groupKind

<sub>default: `'mixed'`</sub>

Allows you to group named imports by their kind, determining whether value imports should come before or after type imports.

- `mixed` — Do not group named imports by their kind; export statements are sorted together regardless of their type.
- `values-first` — Group all value imports before type imports.
- `types-first` — Group all type imports before value imports.

### partitionByComment

<sub>default: `false`</sub>

Allows you to use comments to separate the members of named imports into logical groups. This can help in organizing and maintaining large named imports by creating partitions within the enum based on comments.

- `true` — All comments will be treated as delimiters, creating partitions.
-	`false` — Comments will not be used as delimiters.
- `string` — A regexp pattern to specify which comments should act as delimiters.
- `string[]` — A list of regexp patterns to specify which comments should act as delimiters.

### partitionByNewLine

<sub>default: `false`</sub>

When `true`, the rule will not sort the members of named imports if there is an empty line between them. This can be useful for keeping logically separated groups of members in their defined order.

```ts
import {
     // Group 1
    Drone,
    Keyboard,
    Mouse,
    Smartphone,

    // Group 2
    Laptop,
    Monitor,
    Smartwatch,
    Tablet,

    // Group 3
    Headphones,
    Router,
} from './devices'
```
