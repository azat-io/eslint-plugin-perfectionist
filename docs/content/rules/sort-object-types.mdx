Enforce sorted object types.

This rule standardizes the order of members within an object type in TypeScript. By ensuring that the members are sorted, it enhances readability without affecting the type system or code behavior.

This practice promotes a clear and consistent structure, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain object types.

<Important>
If you use the [`adjacent-overload-signatures`](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/adjacent-overload-signatures) rule from the [`@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`](https://typescript-eslint.io) plugin, it is highly recommended to [disable it](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#using-configuration-files-1) to avoid conflicts.

## Try it out

<CodeExample
  alphabetical={dedent`
    type Department = {
      departmentName: string
      employees: number
      established: Date
      head: string
      location: string
    }

    type Company = {
      ceo: string
      departments: Department[]
      founded: Date
      headquarters: string
      industry: string
      name: string
    }
  `}
  lineLength={dedent`
    type Department = {
      departmentName: string
      employees: number
      established: Date
      location: string
      head: string
    }

    type Company = {
      departments: Department[]
      headquarters: string
      industry: string
      founded: Date
      name: string
      ceo: string
    }
  `}
  initial={dedent`
    type Department = {
      location: string
      departmentName: string
      employees: number
      head: string
      established: Date
    }

    type Company = {
      ceo: string
      departments: Department[]
      headquarters: string
      name: string
      industry: string
      founded: Date
    }
  `}
  client:load
  lang="ts"
/>

## Options

This rule accepts an options object with the following properties:

### type

<sub>default: `'alphabetical'`</sub>

Specifies the sorting method.

- `'alphabetical'` — Sort items alphabetically (e.g., “a” < “b” < “c”).
- `'natural'` — Sort items in a natural order (e.g., “item2” < “item10”).
- `'line-length'` — Sort items by the length of the code line (shorter lines first).

### order

<sub>default: `'asc'`</sub>

Determines whether the sorted items should be in ascending or descending order.

- `'asc'` — Sort items in ascending order (A to Z, 1 to 9).
- `'desc'` — Sort items in descending order (Z to A, 9 to 1).

### ignoreCase

<sub>default: `true`</sub>

Controls whether sorting should be case-sensitive or not.

- `true` — Ignore case when sorting alphabetically or naturally (e.g., “A” and “a” are the same).
- `false` — Consider case when sorting (e.g., “A” comes before “a”).

### partitionByComment

<sub>default: `false`</sub>

Allows you to use comments to separate the members of types into logical groups. This can help in organizing and maintaining large enums by creating partitions within the enum based on comments.

- `true` — All comments will be treated as delimiters, creating partitions.
- `false` — Comments will not be used as delimiters.
- `string` — A glob pattern to specify which comments should act as delimiters.
- `string[]` — A list of glob patterns to specify which comments should act as delimiters.

### partitionByNewLine

<sub>default: `false`</sub>

When `true`, the rule will not sort the members of an object if there is an empty line between them. This can be useful for keeping logically separated groups of members in their defined order.

```ts
type User = {
  // Group 1
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;

  // Group 2
  age: number;
  birthDate: Date;

  // Group 3
  address: {
    street: string;
    city: string;
  };
  phone?: string;
};
```

Each group of members (separated by empty lines) is treated independently, and the order within each group is preserved.

### groupKind

<sub>default: `'mixed'`</sub>

Allows you to group type object keys by their kind, determining whether required values should come before or after optional values.

- `mixed` — Do not group object keys by their kind; required values are sorted together optional values.
- `required-first` — Group all required values before optional.
- `optional-first` — Group all optional values before required.

### groups

<sub>
  type: `Array<string | string[]>`
</sub>
<sub>default: `[]`</sub>

Allows you to specify a list of type properties groups for sorting. Groups help organize properties into categories, making your type definitions more readable and maintainable.

Predefined groups:

- `'multiline'` — Properties with multiline definitions, such as methods or complex type declarations.
- `'unknown'` — Properties that don’t fit into any group specified in the `groups` option.

If the `unknown` group is not specified in the `groups` option, it will automatically be added to the end of the list.

Each property will be assigned a single group specified in the `groups` option (or the `unknown` group if no match is found).
The order of items in the `groups` option determines how groups are ordered.

Within a given group, members will be sorted according to the `type`, `order`, `ignoreCase`, etc. options.

Individual groups can be combined together by placing them in an array. The order of groups in that array does not matter.
All members of the groups in the array will be sorted together as if they were part of a single group.

#### Example

```ts
type User = {
  firstName: string // unknown
  lastName: string  // unknown
  username: string  // unknown
  job: {            // multiline
    // Stuff about job
  }
  localization: {   // multiline
    // Stuff about localization
  }
}
```

`groups` option configuration:

```js
{
  groups: [
    'unknown',
    'multiline',
  ]
}
```

### customGroups

<sub>
  type: `{ [groupName: string]: string | string[] }`
</sub>
<sub>default: `{}`</sub>

You can define your own groups and use custom glob patterns or regex to match specific object type members.

Use the `matcher` option to specify the pattern matching method.

Each key of `customGroups` represents a group name which you can then use in the `groups` option. The value for each key can either be of type:
- `string` — A type member's name matching the value will be marked as part of the group referenced by the key.
- `string[]` — A type member's name matching any of the values of the array will be marked as part of the group referenced by the key.
The order of values in the array does not matter.

Custom group matching takes precedence over predefined group matching.

#### Example

Put all properties starting with `id` and `name` at the top, combine and sort metadata and multiline properties at the bottom.
Anything else is put in the middle.

```ts
type User = {
  id: string                 // top
  name: string               // top
  age: number                // unknown
  isAdmin: boolean           // unknown
  lastUpdated_metadata: Date // bottom
  localization: {            // multiline
    // Stuff about localization
  }
  version_metadata: string   // bottom
}
```

`groups` and `customGroups` configuration:

```js
 {
   groups: [
+    'top',                  // [!code ++]
     'unknown',
     ['multiline', 'bottom'] // [!code ++]
   ],
+  customGroups: {           // [!code ++]
+    top: ['id', 'name']     // [!code ++]
+    bottom: '*_metadata'     // [!code ++]
+  }                         // [!code ++]
 }
```

### matcher

<sub>default: `'minimatch'`</sub>

Determines the matcher used for patterns in the `partitionByComment` and `customGroups` options.

- `'minimatch'` — Use the [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) library for pattern matching.
- `'regex'` — Use regular expressions for pattern matching.
