# Integrations

The best way to use ESLint Plugin Perfectionist is to configure it to fix errors on save in your code editor. This ensures your code stays clean and organized automatically.

## JetBrains IDE

Open Settings (<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>), then select Languages & Frameworks / Code Quality Tools / ESLint. Check the box next to "Run eslint --fix on save".

## Vim

If you are using [ALE Vim plugin](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) add the following code to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
let g:ale_fix_on_save = 1
```

## Visual Studio Code

If you are using [ESLint extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint) for VS Code open your `settings.json` file:

Press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> and type "Open User Settings (JSON)".

Then add the following code to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": true
  }
}
```
