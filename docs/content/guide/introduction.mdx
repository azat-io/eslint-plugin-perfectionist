# Introduction

ESLint Plugin Perfectionist is a powerful tool designed to set rules for formatting your code and ensuring it remains consistent across your project.

This plugin defines rules for sorting various data structures, such as objects, imports, TypeScript types, enums, JSX props, and more. By enforcing a consistent style, it helps improve collaboration, increase development efficiency, and make the code more understandable and maintainable.

## Why

Sorting imports and properties in software development offers numerous benefits:

- **Readability**: Finding declarations in a sorted, large list is quicker and easier. Remember, you read code much more often than you write it.

- **Maintainability**: Sorting imports and properties is considered a best practice in software development. It enhances code quality and ensures consistency across the codebase.

- **Code Review and Collaboration**: By setting strict formatting rules, you eliminate the need for developers to debate on how to organize code. This streamlines the code review process and fosters better collaboration.

- **Code Uniformity**: When all code looks exactly the same, it is very hard to see who wrote it, which makes achieving the lofty goal of collective code ownership easier.

- **Aesthetics**: Beyond functional benefits, a well-formatted codebase is aesthetically pleasing. It gives your code a harmonious structure and visual appeal.

Take your code to the beauty salon!
