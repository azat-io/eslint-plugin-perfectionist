import CodeTabs from '../../components/CodeTabs.svelte'
import { dedent } from 'ts-dedent'

Configuration for the `eslint-plugin-perfectionist` plugin, which provides all plugin rules with predefined options: alphabetical sorting in ascending order.

Uses [localeCompare](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/localeCompare) to sort elements.

It makes it just a tiny bit faster to find a declaration in a large list. Remember, you read code far more than you write it.

## When to Use

Use the recommended-alphabetical configuration when you want to enforce a consistent alphabetical order across various data structures in your codebase.

This configuration is particularly useful in large projects where readability and maintainability are crucial.

It helps in quickly locating declarations and ensures that similar elements are grouped together, reducing cognitive load for developers navigating the code.

## Usage

<CodeTabs
  code={[
    {
      source: dedent`
        // eslint.config.js
        import perfectionist from 'eslint-plugin-perfectionist'

        export default [
          perfectionist.configs['recommended-alphabetical'],
        ]
      `,
      name: 'Flat Config',
      value: 'flat',
    },
    {
      source: dedent`
        // .eslintrc.js
        module.exports = {
          extends: [
            'plugin:perfectionist/recommended-alphabetical-legacy',
          ],
        }
      `,
      name: 'Legacy Config',
      value: 'legacy',
    },
