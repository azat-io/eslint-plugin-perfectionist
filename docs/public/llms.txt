# ESLint Plugin Perfectionist

> ESLint plugin for sorting various data such as objects, imports, types, enums, JSX props, etc. Enforce a consistent code style with automatic sorting and organization of your TypeScript and JavaScript code.

ESLint Plugin Perfectionist is a powerful tool designed to set rules for formatting your code and ensuring it remains consistent across your project.

Key features:

- Automatically fixable rules for safe code formatting
- Support for multiple sorting methods: alphabetical, natural, line-length, and custom
- TypeScript-first with full JavaScript support
- Extensive configuration options for fine-tuning
- Compatible with ESLint v8.45.0 or greater
