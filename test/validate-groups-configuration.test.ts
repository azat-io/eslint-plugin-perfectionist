 * It is currently not possible to test rules that throw errors
 * (https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/13434), so getting 100% code
 * coverage is not possible only through ESLint's  RuleTester as there is no way
 * to catch the error thrown from `validateGroupsConfiguration`. We can get 100%
 * coverage temporarily with this unit test until that feature is implemented in
 * ESLint.
